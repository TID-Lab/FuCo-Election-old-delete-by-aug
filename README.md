# FuCo-Election
Mono-repo for the Fulton County Election dashboard frontend and backend


## dev setup

- its recommended to use a node version manager of sorts. on linux/mac use `nvm`. on windows, there are two options: `nvm-windows` and `nvs`. I prefer `nvs`.


1. make sure you are using `node 20` or higher (lts as of 2024)

2. we use `pnpm` as package manager (to manage the monorepo, also its faster and uses less space) instead of `npm`. install by `npm -g pnpm`.

3. run `pnpm install`;
